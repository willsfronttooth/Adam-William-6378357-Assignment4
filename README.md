# Product Performance Analysis — Submission Package

This repository provides a ready-to-run pipeline that:
- Preprocesses product_sales.csv (handles missing values, outliers, scaling)
- Implements K-means from scratch (kmeans++) and computes elbow & clusters
- Trains Linear and Polynomial regression models to predict profit
- Generates plots and a written REPORT.md (and optionally REPORT.pdf)

Repository structure
- data/product_sales.csv   # dataset (provided)
- src/
  - preprocessing.py
  - kmeans_custom.py
  - regression_models.py
  - visualize.py
- generate_report.py       # main script — runs entire pipeline and writes REPORT.md
- results/                 # created by script, contains plots
- REPORT.md                # generated by script
- requirements.txt

How to run
1. Create virtual environment (recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # mac/linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # windows

2. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the pipeline
   python generate_report.py

   - This writes:
     - results/elbow.png
     - results/cluster_price_units.png
     - results/actual_vs_predicted.png
     - results/residuals.png
     - REPORT.md
   - If you have pandoc installed, the script will try to convert REPORT.md to REPORT.pdf.

Notes
- I cannot execute the script from here. Run it locally to generate the filled report and images.
- If you want, after running you can paste the generated REPORT.md (or REPORT.pdf) here and I will help polish language, interpretations, and finalize for submission.

Academic Integrity
- This package provides code, outputs and a report template. You must understand and be able to explain every part of the submission.

If you want me to:
- Produce a zip file with all files included (I cannot create files here, but I can provide an archive command to run locally), or
- Walk you through running the script and share/interpret the outputs you get,
tell me which and I will guide you step-by-step.
